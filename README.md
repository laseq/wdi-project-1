### Introduction

Battleship is a popular turn based game where the aim of the game is to sink your opponent's ships before they sink yours. In a real life setting, both players would place their ships on their grid, and call out co-ordinates to hit ships on their opponent's grid. A hit is marked with a red counter while a miss is marked with a white counter.

In this version of Battleship, you'll play against the computer and your ships will be randomly placed for you at the start of the game.

### How to play

The player is given the instruction at the start to choose a square to bomb on the tracking grid. If you hit a ship, that square will turn red. Miss, and the square will turn a blueish white.

The player is informed about which ships they hit and sink in the information bar and boxes at the top.

The winner is the first player to destroy their enemy's fleet.
